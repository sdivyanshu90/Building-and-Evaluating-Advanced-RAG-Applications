      "Imposter syndrome is when individuals doubt their accomplishments and have a persistent fear of being exposed as a fraud, despite evidence of their success. In the context of AI, newcomers to the field may experience imposter syndrome as they navigate the technically complex nature of artificial intelligence and interact with highly capable individuals. It is highlighted that imposter syndrome is a common experience, even among accomplished figures in the AI community, and that overcoming challenges and setbacks is a natural part of the learning process in AI.\n",
